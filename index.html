        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Welcome to Nick G. Parras Middle School, in Redondo Beach Unified School District. Our school has been recognized for its outstanding programs and academics by being named a California Green Ribbon School, a California Distinguished School, and a California Gold Ribbon School. Parras Middle School is in the top tier of all middle schools in the state of California.
            <br>
            Our Mission Statement is “To ensure continual growth in every student's learning and academic achievement while promoting responsible citizenship.” There is a lot in this short statement. “Continual growth,” for instance, aligns to the value of lifelong learning, something we hope is engendered here, and only grows stronger in years beyond. “Every student’s learning and achievement” is not said just because we are a public school, but because we know that we must pay attention to the individual needs of each student to ensure that we are maximizing their potential. And finally, “responsible citizenship” prioritizes the social-emotional development of our students, which is the foundation for thriving in all aspects of their lives.
            <br>
            At Parras we are more than just school—we are a community. We work hard to create effective collaboration among staff and families to offer more than any of us could individually. For teachers, this includes coaches and co-teaching partnerships. For parents, this includes our incredible PTSA, who orchestrate an unbelievable amount of support ranging from running registration, to creating and implementing the Hands-on-Art program. Another critical partner is the Redondo Beach Educational Foundation (RBEF), who annually funds over a million dollars in programs and staff that impact every RBUSD student. Learn more at http://rbef.org/.
            <br>
            Above all, we are dedicated to students finding success here—which we know means different things for different people—but must always at least include feeling valued and respected. We thank you for your support and partnership in this goal, and together we will continue to build the legacy of Parras through the success of our students.
            <br>
            Warmly,
            <br>
            Jonathan Erickson Principal

                    <p class="text-success text-left">A playground, playpark, or play area is a place specifically designed to enable children to play there. It is typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some target other age groups or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below a certain age.
                        Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.
                        Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.
                        Public playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use.
                        A type of playground called a playscape is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.

                    <p class="text-success text-left">The United States Surgeon General has stated that regular physical activity is one of the most important things people can do to maintain and improve their physical health, mental health, and overall well-being. A student who is physically educated is more likely to become a healthy adult motivated to remain healthy and physically active throughout his or her life.
                        As such, physical education is an integral part of the overall educational offering for all students at Parras Middle School. Parras students are enrolled in daily physical education classes for all three years in attendance, and are therefore afforded multiple opportunities to be immersed in a health-enhancing comprehensive program.
                        The physical education program at Parras teaches students how their bodies move, how to perform a variety of physical activities, the health-related benefits of regular physical activity, and specific skills that will allow them to adopt a physically active, healthy lifestyle. It also provides learning experiences that meet the developmental needs of all students. With physical education, students become confident, independent, self-controlled, and resilient; develop positive social skills; learn to set and strive for personal, achievable goals; learn to assume leadership, cooperate with others, and accept responsibility for their own behavior; and improve their academic performance.
                        Education Code Section 51222 provides for 400 minutes of physical education every 10 school days for students at the middle school level. The program at Parras adheres to the California Model Content Standards, effectively answering the question, “What should California students know and be able to do in Physical Education?” Students earn grades that are reflective of how well they meet these critical standards for healthy living.
